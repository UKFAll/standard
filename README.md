Fireball data exchange standard
This repository contains documentation of the standard for exchange of astrometric and photometric data between fireball or meteor camera systems.  The data relates to the capture by a single meteor camera of a single meteor path.  It is intended to include all trajectory data in a single data file, including for multiple fragments and for different positional measurements.
